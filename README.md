# ðŸ‘‹ðŸ§© ReVanced Patches template

This is a template for creating a new ReVanced Patches repository.  
The repository can have multiple patches, and patches from other repositories can be used together.

For an example repository, see [ReVanced Patches](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches).

##  ðŸš€ Get started 

To start using this template, follow these steps:

1. [Create a new repository using this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=revanced-patches-template&template_owner=ReVanced)
2. Set up the [build.gradle.kts](build.gradle.kts) file (Match the [group of the project](build.gradle.kts#L8), [manifest attributes](build.gradle.kts#L35-L43), and the [POM](build.gradle.kts#L84-L106) that will be published to yours)
3. Update the dependencies in the [libs.versions.toml](gradle/libs.versions.toml) file
4. [Add a secret](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) to your repository named [REPOSITORY_PUSH_ACCESS](.github/workflows/release.yml#L47) containing a GitHub access token with [push access](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/ci-configuration.md#authentication) 
5. Set up the [README.md](README.md) file[^1] (e.g title, description, license, short summary of the patches that are included in the repository)

ðŸŽ‰ You are now ready to start creating patches!

## ðŸ”˜ Optional steps

You can also add the following things to the repository:

- [Issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)[^2]
- Contribution guidelines[^3]
- Documentation, if you want to publish your patches as a library[^4]
